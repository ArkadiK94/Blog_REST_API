# Blog_Server_REST_API

### Project that I did due to a Udemy Course that I took. The name of the course "NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)".

Technologies that we used:
1. nodeJS - Backend
2. expressJS - Nodejs framework
3. rest api 
4. websocket protocol with socket.io
5. mongoose - Object Data Modeling for mongoDB
6. jsonwebtoken


Important features from NodeJS and other used libraries:
1. Handling Requsts & Respones with sending JSON DATA 
2. Authentication with jwt
3. Handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing Errors


* Using the server with Blog app which was build with ReactJS (the frontend was not added to github)
